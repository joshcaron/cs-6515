Software Development
====================

History
-------
I am taking a graduate-level course as an undergrad, CS 6515 - Software Development. The course accepts roughly 10-15 undergraduate students when it is offered and provides the opportunity to experience an intense and fulfilling course. The workload is extreme, but I have already gained valuable skills in time managment, server-side interfaces, and implementation of interfaces. Each project in the course is in it's own folder. More information about each project can be found [here](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/6515-s13/index.html).
