The course accepts roughly 10-15 undergraduate students when it is offered and provides the opportunity to experience an intense and fulfilling course. The workload is extreme, but I have already gained valuable skills in time managment, server-side interfaces, and implementation of interfaces. Each project in the course is in it's own folder. More information about each project can be found [here](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/6515-s13/index.html). \r\n\r\nWhat's inside\r\n-------------\r\n* Project folders for each part of the course\r\n\r\nProject 1\r\n---------\r\n\r\n\r\nProject 2\r\n---------\r\n\r\n\r\nProject 3\r\n---------\r\n\r\n"}
